First you have to prepare your .proto file.and make sure that your header contains the following:
syntax = "proto3";package chaincode;option go_package = "./";

Put your proto file in the same directory as the smart contract. Then run the following command:
protoc --go_out=. --go_opt=paths=source_relative --go-grpc_out=. --go-grpc_opt=paths=source_relative ./chunk.proto

where message is the name of your proto file 
This command will create a new file named message.pb.go. open this file and make sure to change:
package __    to be: package chaincode

Then save the file, and now the proto file is fully connected with your chaincode without any further import commands.
Then now you can deploy the smart contract now using your data and path:
 
 

./network.sh deployCC -ccn protoChunkContract -ccp ../asset-transfer-basic/chaincode-go-protoTestContract1-Chunk/ -ccl go
