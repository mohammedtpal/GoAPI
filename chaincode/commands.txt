first you have to prepare your .proto file
and make sure that your header contains the following:

syntax = "proto3";
package chaincode;
option go_package = "./";


put your proto file on the same dir of the smart contract 
then run the following command:

protoc --go_out=. --go_opt=paths=source_relative   --go-grpc_out=. --go-grpc_opt=paths=source_relative   message.proto

where message is the name of your proto file 

this command will create new file named: message.pb.go 
open this file and make sure to change:
package __    to be: package chaincode

then save the file and now the proto file is fully connected with your chaincode without any further import commands


then now you can deploy the smart contract:

./network.sh deployCC -ccn protoTestContract1 -ccp ../asset-transfer-basic/chaincode-go3/ -ccl go
